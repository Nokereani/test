  <h1>Intro to Mechanical Keyboards</h1>
  <p class="tab">A mechanical keyboard is a typing device that uses mechanical switches to register key presses. You may have used one in decades past and remember it as a loud clicky keyboard, or more recently on popular gaming keyboards.</p>
  <p>Today, most consumer keyboards and laptops use a “membrane” that uses a linked pressure pad to register keypresses, rather than individual switches. In this course, we’ll be looking at why a growing global community is moving away from membranes to bigger and better options in mechanical keebs. </p>
